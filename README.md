# Analyzing Sales Data From a Walmart data set

By analyzing sales data using SQL, businesses can gain insights into their sales performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to increase revenue and profitability.

Dataset: Use the Walmart Sales Dataset available on Kaggle for this project that contains the following variables:

* Store - the store number 
* Date - the week of sales
* Holiday - whether the week is a special holiday week or not
* Temperature - the average temperature in the region during the week
* Fuel_Price - the cost of fuel in the region during the week
* MarkDown1-5 - anonymized data related to promotional markdown events
* CPI - the consumer price index in the region
* Unemployment - the unemployment rate in the region
* IsHoliday - whether the week is a holiday week or not
* Weekly_Sales - the sales for the given store and date

SQL Data Analysis Project Idea: Design SQL queries to answer the following questions:

* What was the total revenue generated by the retailer during the time period covered by the dataset?
* Which product had the highest total revenue?
* Which customers generated the most revenue for the retailer?
* How many unique products were sold?
